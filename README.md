# Minesweeper

The objective is to implement a game where the player controls a character thatyou have to go from point A to point B in a minefield.

In Minesweeper, the player has to discover all the mines in a given terrain. The objective is to “clear” the land of mines, marking their location.

# More about the project

The game will show a menu where you will need to enter "1" to start the game.
Then it will be asked to put the number of lines, columns and mines(pressed ENTER, it will give a default number).
Next, you will see the terrain with the position of the player ("P), the numbers, the mines hiding and finishing line ("f)
If you die to a bomb or if you finish the game, the terrain shows all the mines hiding :D
